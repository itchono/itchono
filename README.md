### Hi, I'm Mingde 👋

I am currently working at [SpaceRyde](https://www.spaceryde.com/) as a rocket avionics intern. My key interests are in aerospace vehicles dynamics and control, trajectory planning and optimization, and orbital spacecraft. My background is in numerical methods and modelling, simulation and control systems.

I just finished my 3rd year of Aerospace Engineering at the University of Toronto.
