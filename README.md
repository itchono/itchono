### Hi, I'm Mingde 👋

I am currently working at [MDA](https://mda.space/en/) as a Guidance, Navigation, and Controls intern. I previously worked at [SpaceRyde](https://www.spaceryde.com/) as a rocket avionics intern. My key interests are in **aerospace vehicles dynamics and control, trajectory planning and optimization, and orbital spacecraft**. My background is in numerical methods and modelling, simulation and control systems.

I am entering my 4th year of Aerospace Engineering at the University of Toronto. My educational background is in aerodynamics, gasdynamics, numerical methods, optimization, and control systems.

I am a subsystem lead at the [University of Toronto Aerospace Team Space Systems division](https://www.utat.ca/space-systems) working on trajectory analysis and mission planning for a 3U imaging cubesat mission.
