### 🌱 I’m currently learning...
* Speedy computation and optimization techniques in Python 🐍
* How to make my code better and more readable 📑
* Replacing frequently called Python code with Go 💨
* Spacecraft dynamics and orbital mechanics 🌎

### 😎 Cool things I have previously worked on...
* [Optimal pathfinding algorithms for Snake](https://github.com/itchono/ESC190-snek)
* [Magnetic Field Determination of Arbitrarily shaped coils in Free Space](https://github.com/vuthalab/biot-savart)

* [A rudimentary drawing tool](http://mingde.tk/altair/)

Disclaimer: I am an engineer first and foremost, so a lot of the code you see here will not be of the typical CS-student flavour. (My frontend knowledge is basically nil so most of the stuff I make ends up looking pretty ugly)
