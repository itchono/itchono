### Hi, I'm Mingde 👋

I am currently working at [SpaceRyde](https://www.spaceryde.com/) as a rocket avionics intern. My key interests are in **aerospace vehicles dynamics and control, trajectory planning and optimization, and orbital spacecraft**. My background is in numerical methods and modelling, simulation and control systems.

I just finished my 3rd year of Aerospace Engineering at the University of Toronto. My educational background is in aerodynamics, gasdynamics, numerical methods, optimization, and control systems.

I am a subsystem lead at the [University of Toronto Aerospace Team Space Systems division](https://www.utat.ca/space-systems) working on trajectory analysis and mission planning for a 3U imaging cubesat mission.

### 🔭 I’m currently working on...
* [An interplanetry mission trajectory optimizer using multi-flyby gravity assists](https://github.com/itchono/trajectorize) 🚀
* [Orbital simulations for my school's microsatellite design team](https://github.com/spacesys-finch/hypernova) 📡
* [A multipurpose Discord bot for use on my own Discord server](https://github.com/itchono/Comrade) 🏠
* [A quiz bot for Discord to help make you smarter](https://github.com/micropipette/studybot) 🧠

### 🌱 I’m currently learning...
* Using C and C++ extensions to accelerate my Python code 💨
* Spacecraft dynamics and orbital mechanics 🌎
* Higher performance numerical methods for dynamic systems 🌌
* Navigation, state estimation, guidance, and control for aerospace vehicles 🚀

### 😎 Cool things I have previously worked on...
